## Overview

Your challenge is to build out this quiz app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Select a quiz subject
- Select a single answer from each question from a choice of four
- See an error message when trying to submit an answer without making a selection
- See if they have made a correct or incorrect choice when they submit an answer
- Move on to the next question after seeing the question result
- See a completed state with the score after the final question
- Play again to choose another subject
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the entire app only using their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Change the app's theme between light and dark

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

Iâ€™ve learned more about how to manipulate the DOM and make changes to a webpage through JavaScript. I also got better at accessing values in arrays and objects, which made handling data easier to understand. On top of that, I practiced using functions and events, which really helped me make my project more interactive.

### Continued development

I plan to continue developing this app by learning and applying new techniques, tools, and technologies. My goal is to turn it into a random question quiz app, add more questions, and introduce additional features in the future.
