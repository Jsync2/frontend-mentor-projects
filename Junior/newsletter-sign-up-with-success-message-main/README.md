## Overview

The challenge is to build out this newsletter form and get it looking as close to the design as possible and add some

- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

My web development process starts with semantic HTML to build a clear, meaningful structure, then I add content like text and images so the page feels real. Next, I handle layout with CSS, usually mobile-first, followed by stylingâ€”colors, fonts, and visuals to make it look good. Finally, I add JavaScript for interactivity, like clicks and dynamic updates. This step-by-step approach keeps my sites organized, responsive, and easy to maintain.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned JavaScript DOM manipulation to change page content dynamically, and local storage to save data in the browser. I also practiced passing parameters between functions and styling elements with JavaScript. These skills let me make my pages more interactive and responsive.
